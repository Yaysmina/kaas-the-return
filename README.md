# Kaas: The Return
One of the first gamed I ever programmed was a very simple mobile clicker game based on getting milk to make cheese.
This is a full-scale expansion of the old games.
- Buy cows, get raw milk, process into milk
- Sell milk and cheese to a variety customers
- Buy upgrades to increase production
- Unlock the factory to make cheese
- Upgrade machines for new cheese types
- Serve a very special customer

90% of the code is vibe-coded lol
All ideas by me
