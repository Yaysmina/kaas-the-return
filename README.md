# Kaas: The Return
One of the first games I made in highschool was a very simple mobile clicker game based on getting milk to make cheese.
This is a full-scale expansion based on those old games.
1. Buy cows, get raw milk, process into milk
2. Sell milk to moms and dads, get cash
3. Buy upgrades to increase production
4. Unlock the factory to make cheese
5. Sell cheese to a variety of customers
6. Upgrade machines for new cheese types
7. Serve a very special customer

All ideas by me, almost all code is vibe-coded
